Hello Japan, is a one-stop dashboard to start your day smoothly!

I'm sure you've had those mornings where you're bombarded with a chaos of data ðŸ¤® The information we want delivered to us, from news and weather to daily memes, is scattered across different apps! So we find ourselves opening and closing multiple apps just to get that little piece of information... 

Now, wouldn't it be nice ðŸŽ¶ if we could just open up **one** dashboard that displayed **all** the information we needed? Yeah, we thought so too! And that's why we created this app, so you can surf the waves smoothly and simply ðŸŒ±


## Steps to Setting Up!
**1.** Begin by installing the dependencies we used! 
```
yarn install
```
**2.** Get your API key ðŸ”‘ from [Rakuten Rapid](https://api.rakuten.co.jp/en/) API and [Google Maps]()
```
VUE_APP_GAPIKEY=[place your ]
VUE_APP_GAPIKEY
```
**3.** Create a `.env` file and fill it with the following:
```
VUE_APP_GAPIKEY=[place your ]
VUE_APP_GAPIKEY
```
```
yarn serve
```
